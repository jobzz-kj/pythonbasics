#while loops--basically keep doing stuff over and over again.
#use- you don't know when something gonna end!! that's when uses while loop
import turtle
jobzz_turtle=turtle.Turtle()
jobzz='happy'
while jobzz=='happy':  #what is '=='-->it is the equality operator, checks and gives either true or false
  jobzz_turtle.forward(10) #which results in an infinite loop....
